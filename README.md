a quick-and-dirty CMS platform for bloggers that like raw HTML

[See it in action](http://eyi.vybeauregard.net)

Originally created in 2002 from a minimalist FrontPage design, this platform evolved over the years from a simple text include script to a database-driven fulltext-searchable place to log in, post some prose and publish in one quick step.

Things you won't find here:

* comments
* social media integration
* category tagging
* file attachment
* templates
* multiple user control

All post formatting is done in raw HTML by the author. Image support via manual upload and `img src="image.gif"` tags in the post.
